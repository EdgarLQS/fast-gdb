# Changelog

All notable changes to fast-gdb are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- C++17 FileGDB reader products: dependency-free `fast_gdb_linear` and optional GDAL-backed `fast_gdb_hybrid`.
- Unified `GeometryModel` / `GeometryValue` and ISO WKB-first output.
- Point, MultiPoint, Polyline and Polygon support, including multipart, holes, islands, Z, M and ZM.
- Built-in linearization for CircularArc, CubicBezier and EllipticArc descriptors.
- Exact bbox predicates and `.spx` candidate filtering through the shared geometry model.
- Explicit Hybrid GDAL fallback with configurable fast-gdb/GDAL FID offset mapping.
- CMake install targets, relocatable package configuration and CPack archives.
- Windows, Linux and macOS pure C++ CI; Linux Hybrid and sanitizer release gates.

### Fixed

- ArcGIS M-enabled 2D curves that encode the entire missing M array as a single FileGDB `0x42` marker.
- Transactional curve-tail parsing so canonical M arrays remain preferred and malformed descriptors fail closed.
- Missing M values now preserve measured dimensionality and surface as `NaN` instead of consuming descriptor bytes.

### Validation

- Real `testcurve.gdb` acceptance: 2/2 `Curve_Polyline_M_FC` features use `BuiltinCurve`, with zero GDAL fallback.
- FID mapping, WKB type, bbox, length and whole-layer spatial query agree with GDAL within the published tolerance.
- Release and ASan/UBSan/LSan real-data runs report zero failures.

### Known boundaries

- Pure C++ output is linearized standard WKB; native ArcGIS curve objects are not preserved.
- MultiPatch is available only through Hybrid degraded support and does not preserve complete surface semantics.
- Unknown or future FileGDB geometry encodings are not claimed as supported.
- The writer remains experimental and is not part of the v0.1.0 production support statement.
